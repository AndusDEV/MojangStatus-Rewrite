A complete rewrite of original [MojangStatus](https://github.com/AndusDEV/MojangStatus)

Used: [Mojang-API](https://github.com/KevinPriv/MojangAPI), [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson), [Mcsrvstat.us API v2](https://api.mcsrvstat.us/) + code from original [MojangStatus](https://github.com/AndusDEV/MojangStatus)

## UUID - How it works?
UUID is Universally Unique Identifier that replaces your Minecraft username to verify your identity.

### Usage in this app
UUID have two forms:
 1. Trimmed - it does not have "-"
 2. Full - it does have "-"

The [Mojang-API](https://github.com/KevinPriv/MojangAPI) supports only the Full UUID (with "-").

For ex. My full UUID is: **_03776c03-4494-4e30-b2e4-6701c05aeb00_**.

You can get your UUID from sites like [MCUUID](https://mcuuid.net/).

## I'm not associated with Mojang. I'm just creating program based on their API.
